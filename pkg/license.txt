EVE Metrics Uploader 2.x
------------------------

EVE Metrics has been providing the uploader in various forms for about 2 and a half years now, and so far, nobody has been banned from EVE Online for it. If you are banned, it is not our fault. The program however is EULA compatible to the best of our knowledge, and in any case does not provide an unfair advantage since the data is publicly available.
